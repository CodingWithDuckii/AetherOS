# INSTALLING AetherOS

**Installing Vencord**

1. Go to [vencord.dev](https://vencord.dev/)
2. Download and install **Vencord**. After installing, open the file.
3. Close Discord:
      - Click the Discord icon in the taskbar → **Right-click → Quit Discord**  
      - If you don’t see it, check hidden icons.  
      - If it still won’t close, open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`) and end the task manually.
4. After closing Discord, return to the Vencord installer.
5. Select where to install (generally auto-detected).
6. Click **Install**.
7. After installation, reopen Discord.
8. Head to **Settings → Vencord**. If you can see a new **Vencord** tab, it means success!

> ⚠️ **Troubleshooting:** If the Vencord tab does not appear, try restarting Discord or look for tutorials online. (Tip: NTTS tutorials recommended.)
