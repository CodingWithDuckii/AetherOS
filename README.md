# Welcome to AetherOS!
> This is an OS for Discord, which is rounded with animations, Apple emojis, and many more!
> You may ask why we call it OS? Its not an Operating System? You are gonna see why we mean it, OS, when its released
> We have 2 ways of installing AetherOS and 2 versions. The 1st version is just the normal one, but the second is with horizontal servers, which means the servers are above

## INSTALLING AetherOS
**Installing Vencord**

1. Go to [vencord.dev](https://vencord.dev/)
2. Download and install **Vencord**. After you install it, please open the file.
3. Close Discord:
      - Click the Discord icon in the taskbar → **Right-click → Quit Discord**  
      - If you don’t see it, check hidden icons.  
      - If it still won’t close, open **Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`) and end the task manually.
4. After closing Discord, return to the Vencord installer.
5. Select where to install (generally auto-detected).
6. Click **Install**.
7. After installation, reopen Discord.
8. Head to **Settings → Vencord**. If you can see a new **Vencord** tab, it means success!

> ⚠️ **Troubleshooting:** If the Vencord tab does not appear, try restarting Discord or looking for tutorials online. (Tip: NTTS tutorials recommended.)
